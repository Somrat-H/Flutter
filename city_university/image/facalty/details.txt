The paths of human possibility for students,
 as they create and recreate their lives,
 make this an exciting time for City University.
 When we envisioned this university, 
we believed in freedom of academics that stimulates 
the personal and professional growth of a student. We banked
 on our commitments, transparency and strengths.
